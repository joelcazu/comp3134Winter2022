1)I tested the current path and directory using the basename() function and displayed the contents if they were correct; otherwise, they were not displayed.

2)I utilise the relevang functions - file exists() - to verify and ensure that the file requested is truly available, using the path variable as input.

3) Since files usually conclude with an extension after a dot, I checked the for filename. In the parameter, look for a dot.
